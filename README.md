## What is BeQuest?

BeQuest, an older english word meaning 'to give,' is a fork from the PIVX project which is itself a fork from the DASH project. This means that the coin itself supports voting, privacy protection, decentralization as well as proof-of-stake and masternodes. 

## What is the point / What does this coin do?

Our goal is to help. Plain and simple. This project is designed to fund charities, research, and eventually individuals through currency generated via our blockchain. The belief is that giving is a lot easier when it's from a pool, a pool that generates income for all involved no less. We would like to create a blockchain that, through the reward system, will do good for all involved. We want the success of this coin to be the success of the community and of the institutions that join us. Ultimately we would like a completely decentralized community to be a force of good in the world.

## How?

Through the reward system, POS/MNs, everyone will be able to generate their own coins just like any other fork of PIVX, the difference will be that the dev fees or maintenance will be noticeably lower. Part of the rewards will be sent into a pool to be donated as well. This is to allow currency to be sent to a charity or institution of the pool's choice. That's right, the pool voting system will be able to divy up funds to charities with listed EIN numbers. Eventually this will branch out into vetted institutions such as university research departments, indivduals with exceptional ideas, or anywhere donations are accepted. Keep in mind the community will decide what to send to. In the intital stages, and until better vetting processes come about, this will only be charities that have official EIN numbers. Members of the community will have the option to opt out of donation to the pool, but they must choose a place for the donation to go (any vetted charity) and any unallocated donations will go back into the pool.

## How much is donated?

This is proportional to the number of votes each institution gets. Half of the votes going to a single entity means that entity gets half of the donation from the pool (which will be sent every ### blocks).
